# Embedded-Smart-Door-Lock-System-with-Bidirectional-Motor-Control

> Project Overview
- This project demonstrates a simple smart door lock system using Arduino, two push buttons, and a DC gear motor. The system allows manual locking and unlocking of a door by controlling the motor direction through push button inputs.

> How It Works
Button 1: Unlocks the door by rotating the gear motor forward
Button 2: Locks the door by rotating the gear motor in reverse
The Arduino reads button inputs and controls the motor using a motor driver.
