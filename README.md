# Embedded-Smart-Door-Lock-System-with-Bidirectional-Motor-Control
This project implements a simple smart door lock system using Arduino, two push buttons, and a DC gear motor. One button unlocks the door while the other locks it by controlling the motor direction, demonstrating basic embedded control and motor operation.
